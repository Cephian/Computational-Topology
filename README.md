# Computational-Topology

Concise implementations of various algorithms and data structures used in topological data analysis and computational topology.

To a reasonable extent, efficiency is given higher priority than generality.

##### Features:
  - Construct a filtered witness complex from a point cloud
  - Compute persistent homology of a filtered simplicial complex over F2

##### Planned:
  - Construction of alternative point cloud complexes (Čech, Vietoris-Rips, )
  - Rips complex construction
